Odin Recipes Website 

-Created a recipe website to showcase my basic understading with HTML.

Thoughts:

-This was the first assignment introduced in The Odin Project's foundations course. As a beginner in coding, this project challage me to put into practice my HTML skills. I learned how to properly code the HTML boilerplate, create directories and files, nagivate the terminal and how to use a code editor. In addition, I put into use certain elements to change the appearance of the text and create headers, paragraphs, images, and links. Futhermore, I included ordered and unorder lists for the recipes shown in the website. On the other hand, I organized my code to make it look as clean and possible to understand for the viewer.
