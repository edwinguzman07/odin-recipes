# odin-recipes
<p>In this project I'm asked to create an HTML website that consists of a main index page which will included a few links to different types of recipes. </p>

This project is going to demonaste my basic knowledge with HTML. It will show my skills on how to properly code a basic boilerplate for HTML. Also show the types of elements I used to inlcude a heading, images, paragraphs, change the appearance of the text to bold or italic and add direct links to navigate to different pages in the website or a different website.


This project will also test my knowledge with GitHub on how to properly create a repository, transfer the repository to my local machine where then I will clone it on the Terminal. So that then, I can start building the webiste on VSC (Visual Studio Code). Also, this project will show the commit messages I wrote in between building the website when I came across and error or made a change.
